[{"content":"Debian is my favorite Linux distribution. I installed it on my retired PC and use it as my server OS. I have used Debian for over a decade. It is free, open, and very stable. I use it to practice build many server, such as DNS, NAT, SMB, Website, Database, and so on.\nIn 2026, I will rewrite an article documenting my Debian usage. The first section will describe the process of installing Debian, and then I will write more articles about how to use Debian to set up various types of servers.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;m going to show you how to install Debian with VirtualBox. Here we go!\nWe need to get the Debian installation media from the official website first. I am providing the link, and you can click it to download.\nAfter downloading the installation media, open VirtualBox. We need to create a virtual machine. At this step, we do not need “Proceed with Unattended Installation,” so uncheck the box.\nNext, configure the virtual hardware. I recommend increasing the disk size because we will need enough space to set up various types of servers.\nClick Finish to complete the creation of the virtual machine.\nNow everything is ready, and we can begin installing Debian.\nClick Start to power on the virtual machine, then select Install because I prefer using the text‑based installer.\nSelect a language, and choose English.\nSelect your location, and choose Taiwan.\nConfigure locales, and choose United States.\nConfigure the keyboard, and choose American English.\nConfigure the network, then enter a hostname.\nConfigure the network again, then either leave the domain name blank or enter your own.\nEnter the root password.\nRe‑enter the root password.\nEnter your full name.\nEnter your username.\nEnter the password for your account.\nRe‑enter the password.\nChoose Guided – use entire disk.\nPress Enter to continue.\nChoose All files in one partition (recommended for new users).\nChoose Finish partitioning and write changes to disk.\nChoose Yes.\nChoose No when asked to scan extra installation media.\nChoose Yes to use a network mirror.\nChoose Taiwan.\nChoose any mirror you prefer.\nLeave the proxy field blank.\nFor popularity‑contest, choose No.\nFor software selection, choose SSH Server and standard system utilities.\nFor GRUB installation, choose Yes.\nSelect /dev/sda.\nChoose Continue to reboot.\nNow you have a working Debian virtual machine.\nI will share more Debian‑related articles in the future.\n","date":"2026-02-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://yangcj.cc/p/installing-debian-linux/banner_hu_f83501da834447.jpg","permalink":"https://yangcj.cc/p/installing-debian-linux/","title":"Installing Debian Linux Distribution"},{"content":"Oh my God. I cannot believe that my first article is about my broken NAS in 2026. When I was still living in my hometown, I bought a Synology NAS. Synology NAS devices are very convenient and stable. They offer many applications that allow me to access my documents and photos, and even build virtual machines from anywhere. After that, I canceled all of my cloud storage subscriptions.\nBack then, I bought a 4‑bay NAS and used RAID 5 to protect my data. If one hard disk failed, I could simply replace it and the system would automatically rebuild the data. But for the first time, the failure wasn’t the hard disk — it was the machine itself. So I just ended up buying a new one.\nFortunately, I’m used to setting up servers with my retired PCs, and I also have scheduled backups for my NAS data. When I found it was broken, I immediately backed up my backup NAS data from the server to another hard disk, and then I bought a new one. This time, I decided to go with a 2‑bay NAS because I don’t need that much storage space.\nNow all my NAS data has been recovered, and the new NAS is running very smoothly. I can use it just like before, and I hope it will last for a long time.\n","date":"2026-01-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://yangcj.cc/p/my-broken-nas-in-2026/banner_hu_b25bf9e7d3e81d7f.jpg","permalink":"https://yangcj.cc/p/my-broken-nas-in-2026/","title":"My Broken NAS in 2026"}]
